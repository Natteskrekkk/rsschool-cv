## **About**
Starting from my second year at university, I began to think about the possibility of becoming a Frontend developer, but this idea seemed very far away and did not require immediate action. Time passed, I received a diploma in economics, got a job in my specialty, but the feeling of being out of my element did not leave me. And, as it usually (though not always) happens, the moment came for a clear realization that it was time to act and, finally, take up training in a new field for me.

## **Skills**
No programming skills, but there is a desire to get them.

## **Code examples**
```javascript
function multiply(a, b){
 return a * b
}
```
